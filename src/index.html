          <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
          Let's take a closer look at <strong>1,987</strong> aircraft incidents
          from <strong>January 1, 1995</strong> to
          <strong>June 26, 2016</strong>
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The manufacturers of the aircrafts involved in these incidents were
          any of the following: Bombardier, Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas, Embraer,
          or Airbus.<br /><br />
          When there is an aircraft incident, the number of people injured by
          said incident is reported. This metric is made up of both serious and
          fatal injuries. <br /><br />
          The total number of injuries over time, as seen to the left, does not
          appear to have any easily-discernable of trend line. Although it does
          appear to taper off from <strong>2010</strong> on, with
          <strong>2014</strong> being an exception. There are particularly high
          years, such as <strong>1996</strong> and particularly low years such
          as <strong>2011</strong>

        <h2>Let's look closer at <strong>Bombardier</strong></h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          If we filter the data to examine only incidents involving
          <strong>Bombardier</strong>
          manufactured aircraft, we get what we see to the left. As we can see,
          a small fraction of all injuries from these incidents involved
          Bombardier aircraft. <br /><br />
          <strong>Bombardier</strong> is a Canadian transportation manufacturer.
          <strong>Bombardier</strong> has historically been a small player in
          commercial airliners. Much of the aircraft they manufacture are
          private jets. In fact, they have
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/business/bombardier-regional-jets/index.html"
              >recently</a
            ></strong
          >
          removed themselves from commercial airline manufacturing altogether.
          <br /><br />
          The underrepresentation of their aircraft in commercial airline fleets
          is likely why their number of injuries are so low. Incidents involving
          private jets will injure fewer people than those involving commercial
          ones.

        <h2>
          Now let's take a closer look at <strong>Embraer</strong><br /><br />
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Embraer</strong> is another smaller player in aircraft
          manufacturing. They are a Brazilian company which manufactures
          commercial, military, private, and agricultural aircraft. The
          commercial aircraft they manufacture are largely small regional jets
          which often hold from 70 to 124 passengers.<br /><br />
          As one of the smaller manufacturers, both in representation in the
          industry and in size of products, <strong>Embraer</strong> would be
          expected to have some of the lowest injury counts by year of the five
          manufacturers explored here. And this proves to be the case, as seen
          to the left.<br /><br />
          <strong>Embraer</strong> does appear to be poised to grow their
          position in the commercial aircraft industry, however. As was recently
          announced in 2019, a <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-10-03-Boeing-Embraer-Strategic-Partnership-Taking-Shape"></a>joint venture</a> between
          <strong>Embraer</strong> and <strong>Boeing</strong>
          is under works.

            <h2>
              Let's take a closer look at
              <strong>McDonnell Douglas</strong><br /><br />
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>McDonnell Douglas</strong> is an American manufactuer of
              commercial and military aircraft. It was purchased by
              <strong>Boeing</strong> in <strong>1997</strong>, which is now it's
              parent company. <br /><br />
              In the realm of commercial aircraft,
              <strong>McDonnell Douglas</strong> tends to make mid-size aircraft
              that are used for <strong>regional service</strong>. As a result, they
              tend to carry fewer passengers than other larger players like
              <strong>Airbus</strong> and <strong>Boeing</strong>. For example, one
              of their most popular jets is the MD-83, which has a maximum passenger
              capacity of 155. <br /><br />So their total injuries should be
              expected to be lower overall. There are a few years where they rival
              <strong>Airbus</strong>, however.

      <div id="airbusAll" class="page">
        <h2>Let's take a closer look at <strong>Airbus</strong><br /><br /></h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Airbus</strong> is a European aircraft manufacturer. As one of
          the
          <a href="https://dretloh.com/commercialaircraft/">largest</a>
          commercial aircraft manufacturer in the world,
          <strong>Airbus</strong> manufactured jets carry hundreds of thousands
          of parssengers every day.The most popular <strong>Airbus</strong> jet
          is the A380, which has a capacity of 853 passengers. <br /><br />

          Likely because of the volume of passengers they ferry every day, they
          have much higher reported injuries than smaller aircraft manufacturing
          players like Embraer and Bombardier. <br /><br />
          As seen to the left, their peak year for injuries was
          <strong>2009</strong>. Again, There doesn't look to be a discernable
          trend. <strong>Airbus</strong> has very low years and very high years.
          This suggests that crashes are uncommon, and a single one will raise
          their numbers significantly for that year. Particularly since the
          capacity of their jets is so high.

    <div id="boeingAll" class="page">
      <h2>But what about <strong>Boeing</strong>?<br /><br/></h2>
      <p><strong>Boeing</strong>, an American aircraft manufacturer, is currently the largest manufacturer of commercially-used aircraft. With over 40%
      of the commercial aircraft in use today being of strong>Boeing</strong>-make. As mentioned earlier, they
      continue to grow their reach with mergers and strategic partnerships worldwide.<br/><br/>
      As such a large manufactuer, you would expect <strong>Boeing</strong> to have among the highest
      rates of injury out of the five manufacturers explored. When your aircraft make up over 40% of the market, they'll
      also be involved in many of the crashes. Adding to this likelihood is the size of their aircraft.
      Their one of their most popular jets, for example, the <strong>Boeing 777</strong> has a passenger capacity of
      <strong>550</strong>.<br/><br/>
      Boeing has had a bad time of it recently, with the disasters involving the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-airplane/faa-chief-to-testify-at-dec-11-u-s-house-hearing-on-boeing-737-max-idUSKBN1Y622P">Boeing 737 MAX</a>. In general, however, excluding a few outlier years, their injuries have been trending downward since their peak in <strong>1996</strong>. 1996 was the year of the TWA Flight 800 crash,
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800">third-deadliest</a> aviation incident in American history and the Faucett Flight 251 crash, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faucett_Flight_251">deadliest</a> aircraft accident in
      Peruvian history. <br/><br/>
